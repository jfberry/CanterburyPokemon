# Facebook

Over facebook messenger there are two notification groups.  You need to ask to be invited, but there are no restrictions on membership so anyone who is a member already can add you.  Best to ask on the raid groups.

The two groups are:

## Hundos

This shows 100% IV Pokemon found by the map for the entire Canterbury area.  If you only want to see a small section of these notifications, see custom notifications

## Community day, High IV

A special alert channel runs on community days.  This shows Pokemon with an IV of 96%.  These notifications don't show the pokemon map tile, but rather include a link to google maps taking you straight to the pokemon.

# Discord

The discord is open access and can be joined by following the invite link.

There are four discord channels; notifications in these channels are much richer than the Facebook equivelants as Discord allows for higher-fidelity formatting. Most of the notifications contain a link to google maps or the Canterbury Pokemon map to be able to identify exactly where the target is.

## Pokestop change notifications

The `#pokestop-change-notifications` shows changes to pokestops in the local area

## Interesting quests
The `#mapping-quests` currently shows spinda, but in general will track meta-important quests

## Hundos and Nundos

The `#mapping-hundos` channel shows both hundos (100% IV) and nundo (0%) IV pokemon in the local area

## High IV Community Day

The `#mapping-community-day` channel is activated on community day, and generally shows pokemon with IV of 96%+ in the city centre area
